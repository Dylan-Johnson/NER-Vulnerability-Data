A collection of scripts for generating NER datasets from software vulnerability datasets. These scripts use SARD-NIST repositories for the [PHP](https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-suites/103) and [C](https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-suites/112) sections.

Some of the checkpoints in creating the datasets are also included, due to the time they can take to recreate. In particular, the .csv files for the C dataset are very large when preprocessing, so the following are included:

- dataset_raw_step_1.csv & dataset_raw_step_2.csv: The initial data extracted from the SARD-NIST repository. The only compiler token removed from consideration in this data is the 'eof' token.

- dataset_raw_step_2a.csv: Follows the same train of thought as above, with the distinction of removing additional tokens discussed in the paper, such as the parentheses and brackets.

- dataset_preprocessed_(bioes/bios/is).csv: Complete C datasets with NER tags corresponding to the given encoding method, discussed further in the paper. NOTE:  
    * NOTE: The provided examples of these datasets used the dataset_raw_step_2a.csv file as a base.
